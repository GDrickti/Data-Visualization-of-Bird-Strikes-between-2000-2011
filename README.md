# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes-between-2000-2011
This project analyzes bird strike data on aircraft using R, providing insights through visualizations. It includes bar charts, line charts, histograms, and pie charts to depict trends, costs, impacts, and patterns related to bird strikes. The goal is to help aviation stakeholders understand and mitigate bird strike incidents effectively.

# Description of the Graph: Bird Strikes Over the Years
The bar chart illustrates the number of bird strikes on aircraft from the year 2000 to around 2010. The vertical axis represents the count of bird strikes, while the horizontal axis indicates the year. Each bar shows the total number of bird strikes recorded in that particular year.
Key observations:

•	There is a general upward trend in bird strikes over the years.

•	The number of bird strikes significantly increases from 2007 to 2009, peaking around 2009.

•	The count of bird strikes remains high but slightly decreases after 2009.

This trend may indicate improved reporting mechanisms, increased air traffic, or other factors that require further analysis. The data underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to mitigate bird strike incidents for aviation safety.
