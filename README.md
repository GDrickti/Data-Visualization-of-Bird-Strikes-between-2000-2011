# Description of the Graph: Bird Strikes Over the Years
The bar chart illustrates the number of bird strikes on aircraft from the year 2000 to around 2010. The vertical axis represents the count of bird strikes, while the horizontal axis indicates the year. Each bar shows the total number of bird strikes recorded in that particular year.
Key observations:

‚Ä¢	There is a general upward trend in bird strikes over the years.

‚Ä¢	The number of bird strikes significantly increases from 2007 to 2009, peaking around 2009.

‚Ä¢	The count of bird strikes remains high but slightly decreases after 2009.

This trend may indicate improved reporting mechanisms, increased air traffic, or other factors that require further analysis. The data underscores the importance of ongoing efforts to mitigate bird strike incidents for aviation safety.

# Description of the Graph: Yearly Bird Strikes in the US
The line graph displays the total number of bird strikes recorded each year in the US from 2000 to around 2010. The vertical axis represents the total number of bird strikes, while the horizontal axis denotes the year.

Key observations:

‚Ä¢	The number of bird strikes shows fluctuations over the years, with noticeable peaks and troughs.

‚Ä¢	There is a significant increase in bird strikes around 2003, followed by a drop in 2004.

‚Ä¢	The bird strike count again rises, peaking around 2009, before showing a slight decrease in the subsequent year.

This graph indicates variability in the yearly number of bird strikes, which could be due to several factors such as changes in bird populations, reporting practices, or environmental conditions. The overall trend, however, appears to be increasing, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring and preventive measures to manage bird strikes effectively.

# Description of the Graph: Top 10 US Airlines with Bird Strikes
The bar chart illustrates the top 10 US airlines in terms of the total number of bird strikes. The vertical axis represents the total number of bird strikes, while the horizontal axis lists the airlines.

Key observations:

‚Ä¢	The airline labeled "BUSINESS" has the highest number of bird strikes, slightly exceeding 7500.

‚Ä¢	"SOUTHWEST AIRLINES" also has a high number of bird strikes, close to 7500.

‚Ä¢	"AMERICAN AIRLINES" follows, with a significant but lower number of bird strikes compared to the top two.

‚Ä¢	"DELTA AIR LINES" and "US AIRWAYS" also have notable bird strike counts.

‚Ä¢	Other airlines like "AMERICAN EAGLE AIRLINES," "COMAIR AIRLINES," "UNITED AIRLINES," "SKYWEST AIRLINES," and "JETBLUE AIRWAYS" have progressively fewer bird strikes.

This graph highlights that certain airlines experience a higher number of bird strikes, which may be due to their operational scale, flight routes, or airport locations. Understanding these patterns can help in devising better bird strike mitigation strategies for the most affected airlines.

# Description of this Graph: Top 50 Airports with Bird Strikes
Displays the total number of bird strikes recorded at different airports. Here are the key points:

Y-Axis (Total Strikes):
The vertical axis on the left side represents the total number of bird strikes.
The scale ranges from 0 to over 3000 strikes.

X-Axis (Airport Names):
The horizontal axis lists various airport names.
Each airport is represented by a bar in the graph.

Bar Heights:
The height of each bar corresponds to the total number of bird strikes at that specific airport.
Darker shades of red indicate higher strike counts.

Interpretation:
Airports with taller bars have experienced more bird strikes.
Understanding these patterns is crucial for aviation safety and wildlife hazard management.

# Description of this Graph: Bird Strikes by Flight Phase

Provides insights into when bird strikes occur during different phases of flight. Here‚Äôs the description and the answer to your question:

Graph Description:
The graph displays the total number of bird strikes categorized by different flight phases.

Each flight phase (e.g., Taxi, Climb, Approach) is represented by a bar.

The vertical axis represents the total strikes, ranging from 0 to approximately 25,000.

The tallest bar corresponds to the ‚ÄúApproach‚Äù phase, indicating that most bird strikes occur during this phase.

When Do Most Bird Strikes Occur?:

Most bird strikes happen during the ‚ÄúApproach‚Äù phase of flight.

Pilots and aviation authorities need to be aware of this critical phase to implement effective strategies for bird strike prevention and safety.
